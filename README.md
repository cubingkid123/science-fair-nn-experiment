# Science Fair Experiment
Determining the effect of the number of hidden layers and number of hidden layers on the accuracy of a feed-forward neural network used to classify MNIST images.

Not so much trying to determine what hyperparameters perform best, but their effect: ie. 60 neurons was the minimum for a 90+ percent acc, etc.
